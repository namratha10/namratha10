### 🌸 About Me

I'm a software engineer on a journey of growth and exploration. I like to make life smoother by coding out my everyday problems. From building a url shortener app to developing a yelp clone, the world of coding fascinates me, and I relish each step of exploration it offers, one line of code at a time.

### 🛠️ Projects
