### 🌸 About Me

I'm a software engineer on a journey of growth and exploration. I like to make life smoother by coding out my everyday problems. From building a custom note taking app to developing a yelp clone, the world of coding fascinates me, and I relish each step of exploration it offers, one line of code at a time.

### 🛠️ Projects

- 📝 [Notes](https://github.com/namratha10/NotesApp): A custom note taking app to streamline organize thoughts.
- 🍔 [Real-Delis](https://github.com/namratha10/yelp-clone): A Yelp clone that helps users discover and review local restaurants.
